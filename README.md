> Just another on matrix digital rain project

---

## About:

As an old Matrix fan and decided to implement my website in a similar style.

The project is still in progress, but I can already show you something.

Main idea is to configurate a single line, that can appear and disappear symbol by symbol.

Each symbol can switch to another randomly.

Then I decided to make that lines move forward. Nice effect garanteed.

After that the parallax effect can give more pleasure, so I added it.

Then I want a feature, that from any point of the line I can render any word I want, that will disappear as soon I want.

After all a good thing is to make that words, that appears as result of line rendering, clickable.

So it should stop moving and allow me to make click on it with its own callback.

All this stuff I did as it is. Without any reason to be perfect. That just works good anough.

But still, a good recommendation to improve, modify or optimize - wellcome to [issues](/issues/).


## Example:

`npm run develop` and go play with [example](/example/) at localhost:4000.

Thats all at this moment. 


## Notes:

- a lot of calculations while it renders. Be sure you hardware can deal with it. Another one project called __adaptiq__ that will solve some stuff about it, is on the stage of idea.
- uses the [Matrix Code](https://www.norfok.com/portfolio-freeware_matrixcode.html) font. Free for personal use. Not all of letters represented. You can buy and use your own. 
- some more info soon. docs, builds, samples and other stuff.


## TODOs:

- a lot of...
